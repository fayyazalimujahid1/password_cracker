Password cracker by f4Yy4Z

Imagine a scrambled puzzle. You have a jumbled mess of pieces, and your goal is to put them back together to form a picture.
A password hash is like a highly scrambled puzzle. It's a jumbled string of characters created from a password. The trick is, it's almost impossible to unscramble it back into the original password. Â  
A password cracker is like a super-fast puzzle solver. It tries to guess the original puzzle (password) by looking at the scrambled pieces (hash). 


**Important:** While password crackers can be used for good purposes like testing security, they are often used by bad people to steal passwords. It's crucial to use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts.
